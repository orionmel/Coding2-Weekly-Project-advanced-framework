### week 8.1 style transfer
Neural style transfer is an optimization technique that is mainly used to take two images (content image and style image) and mix them together so that the output image looks like a content image, but is "drawn" in the style of the style reference image. <br>

This is achieved by optimizing the output image to match the content statistics of the content image and the style statistics of the style reference image. These statistics are extracted from images using convolutional networks
