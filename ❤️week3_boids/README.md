My homework detail:
=========
· get the boids project up and running. <br>
· Create a new derived (child) class based on the boids class. <br>
· Using the smallest amount of code you can, change the appearance of the new class. <br>
· Create a new vector of your new boids in the project. <br>
· Try to get your two types of boids to pay attention to each other. <br>
· Keep them as two separate flocks, but make it so that each group stays away from each other. <br>
